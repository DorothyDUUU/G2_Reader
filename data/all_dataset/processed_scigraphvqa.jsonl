The BER is the probability of a bit being incorrectly received, while the FER is the probability of a frame being incorrectly received.

As can be seen, the BER and FER for the non-binary code are significantly lower than those for the binary images. This is because the non-binary code has a higher degree of freedom, which allows it to better correct errors.\n\nThe graph also shows that the BER and FER for the non-binary code decrease as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases. This is expected, as a higher SNR means that there is less noise in the signal, which makes it easier to correctly decode the message.\n\nOverall, the graph shows that the random non-binary code C4 with parameters q = 22, nq = 96, kq = 32, dl = 2, dr = 3 and its binary images considered in Table II have good BER and FER performance.

The main difference between the two curves is that the training accuracy of the model trained with gRDA is slightly lower than that of the model trained with SGD.

The BER is the probability of a bit being incorrectly received, while the FER is the probability of a frame being incorrectly received. In general, the BER is a more stringent metric than the FER, as it takes into account the fact that multiple bits can be in error within a single frame.\n\nThe graph shows the BER and FER for the random non-binary code C4 with parameters q = 22, nq = 96, kq = 32, dl = 2, dr = 3 and its binary images considered in Table II. As can be seen, the BER and FER for the non-binary code are significantly lower than those for the binary images. This is because the non-binary code has a higher degree of freedom, which allows it to better correct errors.\n\nThe graph also shows that the BER and FER for the non-binary code decrease as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases. This is expected, as a higher SNR means that there is less noise in the signal, which makes it easier to correctly decode the message.\n\nOverall, the graph shows that the random non-binary code C4 with parameters q = 22, nq = 96, kq = 32, dl = 2, dr = 3 and its binary images considered in Table II have good BER and FER performance.

It is based on the roofline model, which is a theoretical model that describes the maximum performance of a program as a function of its arithmetic intensity and memory bandwidth. The hierarchical roofline analysis extends the roofline model by taking into account the different levels of memory hierarchy in a computer system. This allows for a more detailed analysis of the performance bottlenecks in a program.\n\nIn the graph, the x-axis shows the arithmetic intensity of the program, which is measured in FLOPS/Byte. The y-axis shows the performance of the program, which is measured in GFLOP/sec. The different lines in the graph represent the different levels of memory hierarchy in the system. The blue line represents the L1 cache, the green line represents the L2 cache, and the red line represents the HBM.\n\nThe graph shows that the performance of v3, v4 and v5 is limited by the L2 cache. This means that the programs are not able to access the data in the L2 cache as quickly as they need to. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the size of the L2 cache, the number of threads accessing the cache, or the latency of the cache.\n\nThe hierarchical roofline analysis can be used to identify the bottlenecks in a program and to make improvements to the performance. For example, the results of this analysis could be used to increase the size of the L2 cache, or to reduce the number of threads accessing the cache.", "main_doc": "2008.11326v4.pdf", "documents": "['2008.11326v4.pdf', '1808.09050v2.pdf', '1709.08441v4.pdf', '1710.10733v4.pdf', '1511.07907v2.pdf', '2004.03870v1.pdf']"}

IPVSS is an iterative algorithm that uses a step-size that decreases as the iteration time increases. This allows IPVSS to achieve a fast convergence speed while also avoiding overshooting the optimal solution. Hard-threshold, on the other hand, is a non-iterative algorithm that uses a fixed step-size. This results in a slower convergence speed, but it also reduces the risk of overshooting the optimal solution.\n\nThe graph shows the performance of IPVSS and hard-threshold on a weighted least squares problem. The x-axis of the graph shows the number of iterations, and the y-axis shows the error between the estimated and true solutions. As can be seen from the graph, IPVSS converges to the optimal solution faster than hard-threshold. However, hard-threshold does not overshoot the optimal solution, while IPVSS does.\n\nOverall, IPVSS is a better choice for problems where fast convergence speed is important.

This is because the logarithmic loss avoids penalizing large differences in prediction when both the predicted and the true number are large.

This can help to reduce noise and outliers, and to make the data more consistent. In the case of RSS data, a moving average filter can help to improve the accuracy of distance estimation. This is because the raw RSS data can be noisy and inconsistent, especially in indoor environments where there are multiple reflections and diffractions of the signal.
