=======

> 🎯 **$G^2$‑Reader** is a dual-graph RAG framework designed for complex multimodal document QA. It overcomes "semantic fragmentation" by utilizing a Content Graph ($\mathcal{G}_C$) that preserves document-native layouts and cross-modal alignments through iterative VLM-based message passing. Simultaneously, it employs a Planning Graph ($\mathcal{G}_P$), an agentic DAG that decomposes queries into sub-questions and dynamically refines reasoning paths based on evidence sufficiency.

## ✨ Highlights
* 🏗️ **Dual-Graph Synergy** – Integrates a Content Graph ($\mathcal{G}_C$) for structured evidence representation with a Planning Graph ($\mathcal{G}_P$) for agentic reasoning control.
* 🧬 **Content Graph Evolution** – Unlike static chunking, $\mathcal{G}_C$ preserves document layouts and cross-modal links through iterative joint evolution, where VLM-based message passing enriches node attributes and induces semantic edges.
* 🧠 **Planning Graph Evolution** – $\mathcal{G}_P$ maintains an agentic DAG of sub-questions that dynamically refines its structure based on evidence sufficiency, allowing the system to bridge information gaps through iterative replanning.
