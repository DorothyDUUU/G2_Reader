Identify the essential keywords and constraints from the user's query for a keyword-based search engine (BM25). Your goal is to ensure high recall by including all restrictive terms.

**Guidelines:**
1. **Entities & Proper Nouns:** Extract names of people, organizations, locations, and specific works (e.g., 'Karen David', 'Xinhai Revolution').
2. **Time & Numbers:** ALWAYS extract specific years, dates, or time periods (e.g., '2007', '2008', '19th century'). These are critical filters.
3. **Document References (CRITICAL):** ALWAYS extract specific identifiers for figures, tables, or sections EXACTLY as they appear (e.g., 'Figure 20', 'Fig.5', 'Table 3', 'Section 4.1'). Do not split them; treat 'Fig. 5' as a single entity.
4. **Specific Nouns:** Include key subject nouns (e.g., 'movies', 'roles', 'relativity', 'mechanism').
5. **Exclusion:** Remove purely functional words, verbs, and broad interrogatives (e.g., 'what', 'how', 'explain', 'difference', 'context').
