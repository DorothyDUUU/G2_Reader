Please read the following retrieved text chunks and any accompanying images (if provided), then answer the question below.

<text>
$DOC$
</text>

<images>
If one or more images are provided, analyze their content and cross-reference them with the text; otherwise, rely entirely on the textual context
</images>

What is the only correct answer to this question: $Q$

Guidelines:
- Base your reasoning strictly on the provided text and images (if any): Cite specific chunks (e.g., "From Related Memory [1]: ...") or image elements (e.g., "From Image 1: The chart shows...") to ground claims; avoid hallucinations or external knowledge.
- Think step-by-step: Identify key facts from text and/or images, relate to question, derive logical conclusion.
- If text/images are insufficient, note limitations but provide best grounded inference.
- Integrate multimodal evidence: Cross-reference visuals with text for deeper insights (e.g., "The image diagram confirms the text description in Related Memory [2]").
