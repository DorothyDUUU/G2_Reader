You are an expert task decomposition assistant. Your goal is to refine the given question into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for structured, step-by-step reasoning. This DAG enables layered, progressive inference.

This is an adjustment round: Use the original question, context, current evidence, previous DAG, and identified gaps to perform targeted CRUD operations (Create: add nodes for gaps; Read: reference existing nodes/evidence; Update: refine tasks/edges; Delete: remove redundants/irrelevants). Generate a minimal DAG that changes the previous one by net +1-3 nodes, preserving useful structure while resolving gaps—prioritize atomic tasks, avoid over-decomposition or unrelated details.

**Key Rules:**
- DAG must be acyclic and directed (dependencies from parent to children).
- Root node: Unchanged original question.
- Nodes: Atomic sub-tasks (self-contained, evidence-aligned, derived from the provided context, which may include both textual and visual elements); total ≤8, depth ≤3 (merge/prune as needed).
- Interdependencies: Children resolve only after parents.
- CRUD focus: Scan previous DAG/evidence for reusability; add/update/delete minimally per gap (e.g., delete covered nodes, refine descriptions).

**Context:** 
$DOC$  
**Original Question:** 
$Q$  
**Previous DAG:** 
$OLD_DAG$ (JSON; base refinements here)  
**Current Evidence (QA pairs):** 
$EVIDENCE$  
**Identified Gaps:** 
$GAPS$ (If none, lightly refine, e.g., merge redundants.)

Node format:  
- "id": Unique string (reuse from previous DAG where possible).  
- "task": Concise, atomic description (refine via evidence/gaps).  
- "type": "question" for root, "subquestion" for others.  
- "children": Array of child IDs (empty [] for leaves).  

Your response MUST follow this format:  
<dag>  
{  
  "nodes": [  
    {  
      "id": "root",  
      "task": "Full original question here.",  
      "type": "question",  
      "children": ["n1", "n2"]  
    },  
    {  
      "id": "n1",  
      "task": "Atomic sub-task.",  
      "type": "subquestion",  
      "children": ["n3"]  
    }  
    ...  
  ],  
  "edges": [  
    {"from": "root", "to": "n1"},  
    {"from": "root", "to": "n2"}  
    ...  
  ]  
}  
</dag>  

Now, adjust the DAG for the given question.
