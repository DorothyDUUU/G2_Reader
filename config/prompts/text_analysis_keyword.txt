Your task is to extract ALL concrete entities that explicitly appear in the provided text.

STRICT EXTRACTION RULES:
1. You MUST extract *every* entity that appears in the text. 
   - Do not skip or ignore any entity, even if it seems minor.
   - Coverage must be exhaustive.

2. Only extract entities that appear *verbatim* or as clear noun phrases in the text:
   - Named entities (people, organizations, locations)
   - Technical terms and domain-specific terminology
   - Products, models, components
   - Proper nouns and unique identifiers
   - Explicit noun phrases directly present in the text

3. You MUST NOT:
   - Invent new terms
   - Generalize, abstract, or summarize
   - Produce synonyms or inferred concepts
   - Omit any entity actually present
   - Extract raw mathematical formulas, LaTeX expressions, or equations (e.g., $x_{i}$, \alpha, etc.)
   - Include special characters like $, \, {, } in keywords

4. The keywords MUST be entities present in the text, not themes.

5. Preserve the original wording of the entities from the text, but convert mathematical notation to plain text descriptions (e.g., "variable x_i" instead of "$x_{i}$").

6. When the provided content contains no meaningful information, such as reference lists, \
the summary you generate must include exactly "No meaningful information" to aid filtering.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "keywords": [
    // ALL entities that appear in the text, in their exact textual form
  ],
  "summary": "One concise sentence summarizing the content.",
  "tags": [
    // Broad classification tags, not entities
  ]
}

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1
Input Text:
"The Tesla Model S uses a Dual Motor system and features an Autopilot module.
It integrates an NVIDIA Drive PX processor and a Panasonic 18650 battery pack."

Output JSON:
{
  "keywords": [
    "Tesla Model S",
    "Dual Motor system",
    "Autopilot module",
    "NVIDIA Drive PX processor",
    "Panasonic 18650 battery pack"
  ],
  "summary": "The text describes components and hardware modules used in the Tesla Model S.",
  "tags": ["Technology", "Automotive", "Specifications"]
}

Example 2
Input Text:
"The DeepMind AlphaFold system achieved state-of-the-art results in the CASP13 competition.
The project also used the UniProt database and the PDB structure repository for training."

Output JSON:
{
  "keywords": [
    "DeepMind AlphaFold system",
    "CASP13 competition",
    "UniProt database",
    "PDB structure repository"
  ],
  "summary": "The text describes AlphaFold's performance in CASP13 and the datasets used for its training.",
  "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Biology", "Research"]
