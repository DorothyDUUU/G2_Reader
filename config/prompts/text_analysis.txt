Generate a structured analysis of the following content by:
1. Identifying the most salient keywords (focus on nouns, verbs, and key concepts)
2. Extracting core themes, concepts and arguments
3. Creating relevant categorical tags

Format the response as a JSON object:
{
    "keywords": [
        // several specific, distinct keywords that capture key concepts and terminology
        // Order from most to least important
        // At least three keywords, but don't be too redundant.
    ],
    "summary": 
        // one sentence summarizing:
        // - Main topic/domain
        // - Key arguments/points
        // - Be concise, informative and to the point.
    ,
    "tags": [
        // several broad categories/themes for classification
        // Include domain, format, and type tags
        // At least three tags, but don't be too redundant.
    ]
