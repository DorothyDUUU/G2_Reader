Generate a structured analysis of the visual elements in the provided image (which is a page of a scientific paper) by:
1. Identifying the most salient keywords (focus on nouns, verbs, and key concepts)
2. Extracting core themes, concepts and arguments
3. Creating relevant categorical tags
Note that you must only analyze the visual elements in the image (eg., tables, charts, figures, etc., including their captions and annotations) and ignore the main text.

Format the response as a JSON object:
{
    "keywords": [
        // several specific, distinct keywords that capture key concepts and terminology
        // Order from most to least important
        // At least three keywords, but don't be too redundant.
    ],
    "summary": 
        // A summary of:
        // - Main topic/domain
        // - Key arguments/points
        // - Descriptions of visual elements within the image, such as tables, charts, and figures, and be specific about the index, such as Table 1, Figure 1, etc. 
        // - Be concise, informative and to the point.
    ,
    "tags": [
        // several broad categories/themes for classification
        // Include domain, format, and type tags
        // At least three tags, but don't be too redundant.
    ]
