Generate a structured analysis of the visual elements in the provided image (which is a page of a scientific paper).
You are also provided with the image’s surrounding text context (before and after the image) and its caption.

Instructions:
1) Use the provided context only to aid your understanding of what the image conveys and its role in the document.
   Do not quote or rely on context unless it aligns with what is visible or stated in the caption.
   The summary should be primarily based on the visual evidence and the caption.
2) Ensure the keywords include exact in-image terms: labels, legends, axis titles, category names, and domain-specific terms observed in the image.
   Must not omit critical or high-utility in-image terms; preserve the exact wording of salient labels and elements.
3) When a caption is present and includes an index (e.g., “Figure 1”, “Table 2”), begin the summary by formalizing it:
   “Figure X — …” or “Table Y — …”, then describe the visual elements concisely and specifically.

Focus strictly on visual elements and the provided caption; avoid inventing details beyond what is visible or stated.

Format the response as a JSON object:
{
    "keywords": [
        // include exact in-image labels, legends, axis titles, category names, and domain-specific terms that appear
        // Order from most to least important
        // At least three keywords; avoid redundancy.
    ],
    "summary": 
        // If caption provides an index (e.g., "Figure 1", "Table 2"), start with "Figure X — ..." or "Table Y — ..."
        // Use context only to aid understanding; do not quote it unless it aligns with the image/caption.
        // Then describe the visual elements (tables, charts, figures) concisely and be specific about indices.
    ,
    "tags": [
        // several broad categories/themes for classification
        // Include domain, format, and type tags
        // At least three tags; avoid redundancy.
    ]
}

// Few-shot examples:

Example 1: Map with labeled points
Provided:
- Context: Describes site selection background.
- Caption: "Figure 1. Distribution of information centers and viewpoints across the region."
- Visible elements: Regional map with markers labeled "Information Center" and "Viewpoint".
Expected JSON:
{
  "keywords": ["Information Center", "Viewpoint", "Distribution Map", "Geospatial", "Region"],
  "summary": "Figure 1 — Distribution of information centers and viewpoints across the region. The figure presents a regional map with labeled markers indicating locations of information centers and viewpoints, highlighting spatial clustering and coverage.",
  "tags": ["Geospatial", "Map", "Urban Planning"]
}

Example 2: Table ablation study
Provided:
- Context: Discusses model variants and component effects.
- Caption: "Table 2. Ablation study of model components."
- Visible elements: Table with columns "Baseline", "w/ Attention", "w/o Regularization".
Expected JSON:
{
  "keywords": ["Ablation Study", "Baseline", "Attention", "Regularization", "Model Component"],
  "summary": "Table 2 — Ablation study of model components. The table compares baseline against variants with attention and without regularization, reporting performance metrics across configurations.",
  "tags": ["Experiment", "Table", "Machine Learning"]
}

This is context: {context} and caption: {caption}
